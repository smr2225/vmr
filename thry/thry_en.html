  <h3>The ascent of matter as qualitative leaps in the development of the organization of matter's forms, driven by a decreasing energy level caused by the expansion of the metric.</h3>
  <div class="theory-content">
<p>Philosophers of the scientific school have observed that matter is in motion, and these movements, over the past 14 billion years, have formed a clear picture of material development, which we present here.</p>
<p>1. The period before the phase transition. Quality: We do not know its nature or how it existed, but it was.</p>
<p>2. Phase transition into the Planck Epoch. Quality: Pure energy; the absence of anything discrete or describable—a kind of universal field (physicists feel the need to label it), akin to Hegel's simple Being.</p>
<p>3. The Emergence of Fields. Quality: The formation of the principles and constants (laws) of reality. The capacity to localize perturbations (energy quanta) and transmit interactions across distance—i.e., reflection.</p>
<p>4. Elementary Particles. Quality: The emergence of discrete properties of matter; substance as stable field quanta, discrete carriers of mass, charge, and spin, with the potential for addition, decay, and interaction.</p>
<p>5. Atomic/Molecular/Galactic Level. Quality: Stable configurations of atomic nuclei and electron shells; chemical bonds; the formation of distinct substances and large-scale structures.</p>
<p>6. Life/The Cell. Quality: An informational mode of organization. A process, based on sensors, of selecting physical interactions, powered by an external energy gradient and directed toward the local decrease in entropy within bounded systems.</p>
<p>7. Species/Ecosystems. Quality: Probabilistic optimization via heredity, variability, and the selection of living beings according to external conditions, indirectly influencing those conditions in turn.</p>
<p>8. The Social Level. Quality: Interaction among living beings based on the division of functions and coordination of actions to enhance the efficiency of existence. The collective organization of behavior and information exchange between individuals.</p>
<p>9. Labor and Culture. Quality: Labor as conscious, purposeful activity aimed at transforming nature and the self—the creation and development of the culture of sentient beings.</p>
<p>10. The Liberation of Reason. Quality: The casting off of the socio-economic fetters of reproduction and exploitation, as well as the terrestrial constraints of gravity. Cosmic expansion as the continuation of matter's ascent and the conscious, supreme purpose of life.</p></div>
